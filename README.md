## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Border-box
- Red Hat Display google fonts


### What I learned

Use of background-image and background size of "100% auto" to get almost similar result as the original.

Use of flex box for the plan details to proprly position the contents in its div container.

Use of overflow: hidden to reveal the top border radius, which was partly hidden by the hero svg image.

I learned how to use Chrome's toggle device toolbar to test the resulting design in the different devices and found them to be satisfactory.  Thus I did not do a mobile device version.

### Continued development

I'd like to see how to render this in a mobile device using media query.


### Useful resources

- [Pictures of the resulting designs]
- [Provision of source for the recommended google fonts]
- [various images for the background]
